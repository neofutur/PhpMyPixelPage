Frequently Asked Questions

Why Pixel Ads?
It may be an internet fad or a new model for advertising.  Purchase a low cost ad that will stay online for the life of the site.  Why not?  Many Pixel sites say you can own a piece of internet history.  We agree.  Family Tree Pixels will keep your ad in place as long as your url is valid and for the life of this site. 

How much traffic will I get?
This site is registered with the top Pixel Ad List sites as well as Search Engines.  Recent studies show that Pixel mania is driving interest and click throughs like never before.

What options do I have?
1 block of pixels is as small of a space as we offer and the smallest space that makes sense.  Interest can be driven through a 10x10 box.  Also this site is crawled so all of our links will also be crawled.

What about Ad placement?
Most pixel sites have a fixed grid.  Each of our sub-grids are composed of 500 x 500 squares (250,000 pixels).  These grids are stacked.  The site will randomly load the grids to balance the top most visible space.   Many ad sites offer cheap pixels below the average browser screen and expensive pixels above.  By randomly loading the sub-grids, we keep the overall placement of your ad fixed in the sub-grid but will rotate which sub-grids are on top.  This is a random function.

What about traffic costs?
Bandwidth and unlimited click-thrus are free.  We are prepared for as much traffic as the Puget Sound can generate.

How do I get started?
Decide on a spot and size and let us know you are ready.  If you have an existing logo or image we can try to shrink it.  Many people choose to do this themselves.
