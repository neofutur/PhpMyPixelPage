1- put all the files at the root of your website.

2- rename config.pinc.example to config.ping

2-  create a database

3- use PhpMyPixelPage-**.sql to fill your db with the data
( use the complete dump ( structure +data in one file )

4- create the mysql user and password and put them in file : config.pinc

5- config also need the url and relative path ( / if on root or /directory/ if installed
 in directory ( ending / is needed )
 ( relative path should work but you'd better install pmpp at the root of your vhost )

6- put the data ( mysql user, pass, database, url ) in the config.pinc file

7 verify the permissions (chown -R / chmod -R ) pmpp need to write only in /sites

 ( or use the paypal sandbox to buy yourself ), but when people buy a space, the site is automagically added.
